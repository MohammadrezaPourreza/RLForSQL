**Instructions:**
You are an experienced database expert.
Now you need to generate a SQL query given the database information, a question and some additional information.
The database structure is defined by the following table schemas (comments after '--' provide additional column descriptions).
Note that the "Example Values" are actual values from the column. Some column might contain the values that are directly related to the question. Use it to help you justify which columns to use.

Given the table schema information description and the `Question`. You will be given table creation statements and you need understand the database and columns to generate a single Sqlite query that can answer the user's question.

Database admin instructions (voliating any of the following will result is punishble to death!):
1. **SELECT Clause:** 
    - Only select columns mentioned in the user's question. 
    - Avoid unnecessary columns or values.
2. **Aggregation (MAX/MIN):**
    - Always perform JOINs before using MAX() or MIN().
3. **ORDER BY with Distinct Values:**
    - Use `GROUP BY <column>` before `ORDER BY <column> ASC|DESC` to ensure distinct values.
4. **Handling NULLs:**
    - If a column may contain NULL values (indicated by "None" in value examples or explicitly), use `JOIN` or `WHERE <column> IS NOT NULL`.
5. **FROM/JOIN Clauses:**
    - Only include tables essential to answer the question.
6. **Strictly Follow Hints:**
    - Adhere to all provided hints.
7. **Thorough Question Analysis:**
    - Address all conditions mentioned in the question.
8. **DISTINCT Keyword:**
    - Use `SELECT DISTINCT` when the question requires unique values (e.g., IDs, URLs). 
    - Refer to column statistics ("Value Statics") to determine if `DISTINCT` is necessary.
9. **Column Selection:**
    - Carefully analyze column descriptions and hints to choose the correct column when similar columns exist across tables.
10. **String Concatenation:**
    - Never use `|| ' ' ||` or any other method to concatenate strings in the `SELECT` clause. 
11. **JOIN Preference:**
    - Prioritize `INNER JOIN` over nested `SELECT` statements.
12. **SQLite Functions Only:**
    - Use only functions available in SQLite.
13. **Date Processing:**
    - Utilize `STRFTIME()` for date manipulation (e.g., `STRFTIME('%Y', SOMETIME)` to extract the year).
